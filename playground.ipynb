    "## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to predict the number of comments given the question of any [r/Askreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/) question. r/Askreddit is a forum where redditors (Reddit users) post questions (about anything really). We try to find the answer to the following question: \"what kind of r/Askreddit questions garner the most interactions?\" This is an interesting question because as someone that regularly browses Reddit, there definitely exists a pattern between the posts that become popular.\n",

    "## NLP\n",
    "\n",
    "As our data is going to be text data, we will have to use NLP techniques to transform text into machine readable dataframes. The most common techniques used are word-embedding, and bag-of-words. Here's approximately how they work:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have the following sentence: *\"I like my big pancakes\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "We can make our list of vocabulary from this sentence: **'I', 'like', 'my', big', 'pancakes'**. Both techniques uses the one-hot (or multi-hot in the case of bag-of-words) encoding (i.e., the word 'like' would be represented by a vector **[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]**). \n",
    "\n",
    "###  Word-embedding\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of word-embedding, a $m \\times n$ matrix will be created, where $m$ is the number of words in the sentence, and $n$ is the number of words in our total vocabulary. As such, our sentence will be represented as such:\n",
    "\n",
    "||I|like|my|big|pancakes|\n",
    "|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n",
    "|1|1|0|0|0|0|\n",
    "|2|0|1|0|0|0|\n",
    "|3|0|0|1|0|0|\n",
    "|4|0|0|0|1|0|\n",
    "|5|0|0|0|0|1|\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bag-of-words\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of bag-of-words, a single array of length $m$ will be created. The value at each index will be the number of occurrences of the word that index represents. With the same vocabulary, *'I like pancakes.'* would be represented as such:\n",
    "\n",
    "|I|like|my|big|pancakes|\n",
    "|---|---|---|---|---|\n",
    "|1|1|0|0|1|\n",
    "\n",
    "### Word-embedding vs bag-of-words\n",
    "\n",
    "Word-embedding holds more information than bag-of-words. For one, one sentence is represented as an $m \\times n$ matrix with word-embedding, whereas it is represented as a $m$ size array with bag-of-words. Most importantly, word-embedding is able to represent the order of the words in the sentence. For example, take the phrases \"yeah no\" and \"no yeah.\" To a fluent English speaker, they have opposite meanings: \"yeah no\" means \"no,\" and \"no yeah\" means \"yes.\" However, they would have the same representation with the bag-of-words technique, whereas word-embedding would be able to properly represent the difference between these phrases. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, word-embedding is much more computationally expensive as each sentence would be $n$ times bigger. It also requires a different type of algorithm to model as each sentence would have a different $n$, making the number of predictors variable. As such, common machine learning methods like linear regression, ensemble tree methods, and many others would not work with the data. This is one reason we have decided to go with the bag-of-words approach. Another reason is that due to the nature of what we're trying to predict, the order of the words in the question may not matter as much as which words actually appear in the question. \n",
